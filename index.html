                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        As I navigate the exciting world of code, I have learned that my favorite part of
                        coding is building from scratch. Mixing a bunch of letters and symbols 
                        together and making a sort of <span class="magic"">magic</span> can be relaxing, stressful and simply fun!

                    About Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My purpose is to make websites that are easy to read, access and use. As we move towards a future that 
                    is becoming more and more dependant on computers and cellphones, my goal is to be able to create websites that 
                    everyone can effectively use and understand. I look forward to working with other folks who believe that websites 
                    can be fun, educational, accessible and magical.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not firing up the command line and coding up a storm, you can find me baking some cookies, or a chocolate cake,
                    maybe cooking a pork loin, or some slow cooked ribs... Anything that involves a hot oven and complicated steps, I'm there!
                    I guess you could say making things from scratch is my thing! What a beautiful thing it is to mix, combine and add a bunch of 
                    seasonings or code and come up with a delicious meal, or easy to read website!

Confusing? Yes. Difficult? Sometimes.
                        Exciting? Yes! Creative? Oh yeah!
