                        Hello and welcome to my page!

                    <p>
                        As I navigate the exciting world of code, I have learned that
                        my favorite part is building from scratch. Mixing a bunch of letters and symbols 
                        together and making some sort of <span class="magic"">magic</span> can be relaxing, stressful and simply fun!

                    <h3>Projects and Skills</h3>
                    <p>
                        Through out my time with Skillcrush, I was able to create a few projects that showcase my skills. 
                        I learned how to harness the power of HTML, CSS, JS, React, and my favorite, GitHub! Those little green
                        squares bring a smile to my face! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I look forward to making websites that are easy to read, access and use. As we move towards a future that 
                        is become more and more dependant on computers and cellphones, we have to be able to create websites that 
                        everyone can use and understand. 
                    </p>

Confusing? Yes. Difficult? Sometimes.
                        Exciting? Yes! Creative? Oh yeah!
