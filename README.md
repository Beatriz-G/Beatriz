<h1>Beatriz Guerrero's Portfolio</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>I created my portfolio with the idea of sharing my projects as a Front End Developer. As I was building the page, I realized that there is more to me than projects. I created 
  a website that showcases my abilities as a developer, that lets you know that my favorite color is pink and that my favorite thing to do outside of code is cooking and baking.
  I hope that you take the time to read through my portfolio and feel as if you know me as a person. </p>
<p>As you scroll through my portfolio you will see sections for About, Projects, Skills, and a Contact Section. Each of these will give you insight into who I am as a person, 
  some of the projects I have done, the skills I have picked up and how to reach me.</p>
<p>Recently, I added a navigation tab that takes you to the Spanish version of my portfolio. I created this tab because speaking Spanish is important to me. I grew up in a 
  Spanish-speaking house to immigrant parents and realize the importance of offering information in both English and Spanish. I grew up translating information for my parents,
  trying to make sense of things in English to help my parents understand better. Having the ability to speak both English and Spanish fluently, I made sure to include both 
  languages in my portfolio.</p>
